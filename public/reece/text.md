The Albatross was a publishing house based in Hamburg/Paris,
producing the first modern mass-market paperback books to be sold in
continental Europe. Albatross stressed contemporary writing and
design. Their competitor Tauchnitz was eventually put up for sale
but couldn’t be acquired by Albatross due to Albatross’ Jewish ties
in the ownership, management, and distribution. The political
context was a significant factor in the interlocking histories of
both companies. Even with the rise of the Nazis, Albatross continued
to publish Jewish and banned authors but the team was eventually
split apart by restrictions on Jewish ownership of property and the
increasing threats. Albatross’ books were produced in great
quantities and are not necessarily rare today, but many disappeared
without trace. Just like Jewish life in Germany today.
